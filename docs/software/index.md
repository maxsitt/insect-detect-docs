# Software

In the Software section we will start by installing some software on your
[local PC](localsetup.md){target=_blank} that will be necessary to set up the
Raspberry Pi, work with [Python scripts](programming.md){target=_blank} in a
remote development environment via SSH in VS Code and stream the video output
from the OAK camera to your local PC via X11 forwarding.

In the [Raspberry Pi Setup](pisetup.md){target=_blank}, we will configure all
important settings of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and change some options, e.g.
to reduce energy consumption. After that we will configure the PiJuice Zero
pHAT for precise power management and install all necessary packages to work
with the OAK-1 camera in our Python scripts.

All Python scripts that can be used for automated insect monitoring are presented
in the [Programming](programming.md){target=_blank} section, together with
detailed explanations and hints for easy adaptation of the code to your use case.
