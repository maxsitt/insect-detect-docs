# Hardware

In this first main section, you will find detailed instructions on how to build
your own weatherproof and solar-powered camera trap with automated real-time
insect detection and tracking. In the [components](components.md){target=_blank}
section, all required parts are listed, including example product links. You
will also need some tools and equipment, which are shown in the
[overview](buildinstructions_overview.md){target=_blank} section of the
building instructions. If you don't own these tools yourself, you could lend
them from someone or go to your local Fablab/Makerspace, where all required
tools should be available.

We will start with [preparing the enclosure](buildinstructions_enclosure.md){target=_blank},
where all of the electronic parts will be mounted inside to protect them from
weather and humidity. In the next step, we are going to
[integrate the hardware](buildinstructions_hardware.md){target=_blank} into
the enclosure. For the [**Full Setup**](components.md#full-setup){target=_blank},
we will prepare everything for [mounting](buildinstructions_mounting.md){target=_blank}
the camera trap and the flower platform in the last section. If you are going
for the [**Minimal Setup**](components.md#minimal-setup){target=_blank},
you can skip this step and use your own mounting option.
