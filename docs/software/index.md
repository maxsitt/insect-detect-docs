# Software

In the Software section, we will start by installing some software on your
[local PC](localsetup.md){target=_blank} that is required to set up the
Raspberry Pi, communicate with it and work with Python scripts.

In [Raspberry Pi Setup](pisetup.md){target=_blank}, all steps to set up the
Raspberry Pi, Power Managers and associated software are explained in detail.

All Python scripts for testing and deploying the camera trap can be found
in the [Programming](programming.md){target=_blank} section, together with
details and tips for adapting the code to your use case.
