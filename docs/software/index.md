# Software

In the Software section, we will start by installing some software on your
[local PC](localsetup.md){target=_blank} that is required to set up the
Raspberry Pi, communicate with it and work with Python scripts.

In [Raspberry Pi Setup](pisetup.md){target=_blank}, all steps to set up the
Raspberry Pi, Power Managers and associated software are explained in detail.

The [Usage](usage.md){target=_blank} section gives intructions on custom
configuration and how to use the scripts for live preview and automated recording.
