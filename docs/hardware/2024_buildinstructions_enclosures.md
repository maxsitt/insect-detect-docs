## 1 Print Drilling Templates

We will use printouts of the PDF templates to mark the positions of the holes
to drill. Download the [`insect-detect-docs`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-docs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip){target=_blank}
repo and go to `PDF_templates/drilling_templates/version_2024`. Print all PDF
templates in original size and cut them out. We will attach them to the
enclosures, mounting plates, HPL sheets and aluminium square tube in the next step.

!!! warning "Actual size"

    Make sure to select `Actual size` for printing the templates in their original size.

## 2 Mark Hole Positions

Use a small strip of adhesive tape on each side to fix the drilling templates
to the enclosures, mounting plates, HPL sheets and aluminium square tube as
precise as possible.

![Fix Drilling Templates HPL Sheets Alu Tube](assets/images/2024_fix_templates_hpl_tube.jpg){ width="600" }

Position a nail or screw in the center point of each green circle and hit it
lightly with a hammer to mark the drill holes (recommended for mounting plates,
HPL sheets and aluminium square tube).

![Mark Drill Holes Mounting Plate](assets/images/2024_mark_holes_plate.jpg){ width="700" }

Use a different pointed tool and push it carefully but with sufficient pressure
through the template (recommended for enclosures).

![Mark Drill Holes Enclosure](assets/images/2024_mark_holes_enclosure.jpg){ width="700" }

Remove the template printouts after marking all holes and keep them as reference
for the respective diameters while drilling.

## 3 Drill Holes

### 3.1 Enclosures

You will need a 6 mm metal drill bit (hole for ventilation plug), a step drill bit
with 20 mm step (holes for M20 cable glands), and a 19 mm forstner bit or similar
(hole for optional LED button). It is recommended to secure the enclosures in a
bench vise while drilling. Drill a small hole (~3 mm) at the marked position for
the LED button before using the forstner bit to keep it in position.

![Drill Holes Enclosure Step Bit](assets/images/2024_drill_holes_enclosure_step_bit.jpg){ width="500" }

---

### 3.2 Mounting Plates

You will need a 3 mm and a 4 mm wood drill bit for the mounting plates. If
available, use a drill press to drill the holes more accurately.

![Drill Holes Mounting Plate](assets/images/2024_drill_holes_plate.jpg){ width="500" }

---

### 3.3 HPL Sheets

**Continue with [5 Apply Screen Protector](#5-apply-screen-protector) if you are using your own custom mounting solution!**

You will need a 4 mm metal drill bit for the HPL sheets. Drill rather slow,
as the bit and sheet could overheat otherwise (stop if you see smoke).

![Drill Holes HPL Sheet](assets/images/2024_drill_holes_hpl.jpg){ width="500" }

---

### 3.4 Square Tube

You will need a 4 mm metal drill bit for the aluminium square tube. Drill slowly,
to avoid overheating. Drill the 4 mm holes through both sides of the tube.

## 4 Attach HPL Sheets

Attach the HPL sheets to both enclosures now, as it would be more difficult
later on when the hardware is already integrated.

### 4.1 Electronics Enclosure

We will start with attaching the 12x24 cm HPL sheet to the larger electronics enclosure.

    :material-circle:{ .circle_red } **8x** Hex Nut M4, **4x** Washer, **4x** Screw M4 (16 mm)

![Overview HPL Enclosure Electronics](assets/images/2024_overview_hpl_enclosure_electronics.jpg){ width="700" }

Drop one of the M4 16 mm screws into each hole in the corners of the enclosure.
Shake the enclosure for the screw to completely slide through the hole or use
the allen key to guide it.

![HPL Enclosure Electronics Screw](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_electronics_screw.jpg){ width="700" }

While holding the screws in place with the allen key, fix them to the enclosure with
one M4 nut each. Don't fasten the nuts too tight yet, we will do this in the next step.

![HPL Enclosure Electronics Screw Nut](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_electronics_screw_nut.jpg){ width="700" }

The enclosure should now look like in the following image, with all four screws
securely attached, but not yet fastened tightly.

![HPL Enclosure Electronics Screws Fixed](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_electronics_screws_fixed.jpg){ width="700" }

Push the HPL sheet onto the four screws and press it down, to make it sit flush
on top of the nuts. If this is difficult, loosen one or several of the nuts, to
be able to adjust the screws to the holes in the HPL sheet.

![HPL Enclosure Electronics](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_electronics.jpg){ width="700" }

When everything is in place, use the allen key to fasten the screws + nuts,
while pressing against the HPL sheet from the other side.

![HPL Enclosure Electronics Fastening](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_electronics_fastening.jpg){ width="700" }

Put the four washers onto the screws and then use pliers to fasten the remaining
four nuts tightly. The HPL sheet is now securely fixed to the electronics enclosure
for mounting later on, while enabling airflow between enclosure and HPL sheet for
better heat dissipation.

### 4.2 Camera Enclosure

In this step, we will attach the 10x20 cm HPL sheet to the smaller camera enclosure.

    :material-circle:{ .circle_blue } Euromas Enclosure M 215 G with drilled holes (lid removed)

    :material-circle:{ .circle_red } **8x** Hex Nut M4, **4x** Washer, **4x** Screw M4 (**2x** 16 mm + **2x** 30 mm)

    :material-circle:{ .circle_yellow } Allen Key (3 mm), Pliers

![Overview HPL Enclosure Camera](assets/images/2024_overview_hpl_enclosure_camera.jpg){ width="700" }

Drop the two M4 30 mm screws into the corner holes on the side of the enclosure
where you drilled the 20 mm hole (these will be used to attach the platform frame
later on). Drop the two M4 16 mm screws into the corner holes on the opposite side
of the enclosure. Shake the enclosure for the screws to completely slide through
the holes or use the allen key to guide them.

While holding the screws in place with the allen key, fix them to the enclosure with
one M4 nut each. Don't fasten the nuts too tight yet, we will do this in the next step.

![HPL Enclosure Camera Screw Nut](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_camera_screw_nut.jpg){ width="700" }

The enclosure should now look like in the following image, with all four screws
securely attached, but not yet fastened tightly.

![HPL Enclosure Camera Screws Fixed](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_camera_screws_fixed.jpg){ width="700" }

Make sure that the side of the HPL sheet with the 4 mm hole in the middle is
located at the side of the enclosure with the 20 mm hole and longer screws.
Push the HPL sheet onto the four screws and press it down, to make it sit flush
on top of the nuts. If this is difficult, loosen one or several of the nuts, to
be able to adjust the screws to the holes in the HPL sheet.

![HPL Enclosure Camera](assets/images/2024_hpl_enclosure_camera.jpg){ width="700" }

When everything is in place, use the allen key to fasten the screws + nuts,
while pressing against the HPL sheet from the other side.

Put the four washers onto the screws and then use pliers to fasten the remaining
four nuts tightly. The HPL sheet is now securely fixed to the camera enclosure
for mounting later on, while enabling airflow between enclosure and HPL sheet for
better heat dissipation.

## 5 Apply Screen Protector

To make the clear lid of the camera enclosure scratch resistant, we will apply
a screen protector. The protector doesn't have to fit perfectly, but should cover
the OAK camera lens completely.

Clean the clear lid thoroughly with a microfiber cloth. Follow the instructions
that came with your screen protector to avoid bubbles forming between lid and film.
