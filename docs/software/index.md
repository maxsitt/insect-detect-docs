# Software

In the Software section we will start by installing some software on your
[local PC](localsetup.md) that will be necessary to set up the Raspberry Pi,
work with [Python scripts](programming.md) in a remote development environment
via SSH in VS Code and stream the video output from the OAK camera to your
local PC via X11 forwarding.

In the [Raspberry Pi Setup](pisetup.md), we will configure all important
settings of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and change some options, e.g. to reduce
energy consumption. After that we will configure the PiJuice Zero pHAT for
precise power management and install all necessary packages to work with the
OAK-1 camera in our Python scripts.

All Python scripts that can be used for automated insect monitoring are
presented in the [Programming](programming.md) section, together with detailed
explanations and hints for easy adaptation of the code to your use case.
