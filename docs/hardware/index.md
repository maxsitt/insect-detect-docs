???+ info "Camera Trap Versions"

     In the following sections, you will find instructions for both the Insect
     Detect camera trap version 2024 and version 2023. While the corresponding
     [paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295474){target=_blank} is
     based on version 2023, it is highly recommended to **follow the instructions
     for the optimized version 2024** if you want to reproduce our hardware design.
     Version 2023 can be considered as deprecated, its documentation won't be
     updated anymore and is only kept for archiving and reference purposes.

In this first main section, you will find detailed instructions on how to build
your own weatherproof and solar-powered camera trap with automated real-time
insect detection and tracking. In the [Components](2024_components.md){target=_blank}
section, all required parts are listed, including example product links. You
will also need some tools and equipment, which are shown in the
[Overview](2024_buildinstructions_overview.md){target=_blank} section of the
building instructions. If you don't own these tools yourself, you could borrow
them from someone or go to your local Fablab/Makerspace, where all required
tools should be available.

We will start with the [Enclosure Preparation](2024_buildinstructions_enclosures.md){target=_blank},
where all of the electronic parts will be mounted inside to protect them from
weather and humidity. In the next step, we are going to
[integrate the hardware](2024_buildinstructions_hardware.md){target=_blank} into
the enclosures. For the [**Full Setup**](2024_components.md#full-setup){target=_blank},
we will prepare everything for [mounting](2024_buildinstructions_mounting.md){target=_blank}
the camera trap in the last section. In the [Field Deploment](2024_field_deployment.md){target=_blank}
section, all steps to set up the finished camera trap in the field are shown.
